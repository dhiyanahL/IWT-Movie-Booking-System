# IWT-Movie Booking-System
 IWT - Y1S2 Web Application Project.

 This web application project was done for Y1 S2 for the Internet and Web Technologies Module, using PHP, JS, HTML and CSS.

My role was to complete the 4 CRUD operations for the User functionality using PHP for backend, JS for validation and CSS for formatting.
My work included coding the CRUD operations for User Login, User Profile Viewing + Updating + Deleting. 
As for the static pages, I completed the About Us page giving viewers a brief understanding of the website.
