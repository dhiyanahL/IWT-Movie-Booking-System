 IWT - Y1S2 Web Application Project.

 This web application project was done for Y1 S2 for the Internet and Web Technologies Module, using PHP, JS, HTML and CSS.

I did the 4 CRUD operations for the User using PHP, JS for validation and CSS for formatting.
My work included coding the CRUD operations for User Login, User Profile Viewing + Updating + Deleting. I also coded the About Us page using HTML.
